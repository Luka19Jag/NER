The venues are security and database security conferences and journals (DBSec, ACSAC, IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, Journal of Computer Security, J. Network Syst. Manage.). The organization is often University of Tulsa or Tulsa Univ., OK, indicating institutional continuity. The topics are coherent around security policy, programmable security, access control, and vulnerability analysis.

Venues include ICGA, PPSN, Machine Learning, and foundational AI conferences. The consistent coauthor network, topic coherence in genetic algorithms and learning classifier systems, and continuous publication timeline without large gaps support these as one individual.",

Coauthors include Werner Vogels, Kenneth P. Birman, and others associated with Microsoft and Cornell University. The venues include FTCS, COMPCON, and ACM Queue. The topics and coauthors indicate a focus on distributed systems and fault tolerance distinct from the core database research of cluster 0/1. The temporal overlap with cluster 1 is partial but the coauthor and topic differences are strong. This suggests a second distinct Jim Gray specializing in distributed systems and fault tolerance.",

Venues include SIGMOD, CoRR, IEEE Computer, Communications of the ACM, and various scientific computing conferences. The consistent coauthor network, topic focus on scientific data management and astronomy, and institutional affiliation with Microsoft Research strongly indicate a distinct individual from the earlier database and distributed systems researchers.

Given the temporal proximity and some coauthor overlap (Russell P. Kraft), this may be the same person transitioning research focus or collaborating across institutions. However, the lack of direct coauthor overlap with the main FPGA cluster's core group and different institutional affiliation suggests this might be a distinct early-career phase or possibly a different individual.
